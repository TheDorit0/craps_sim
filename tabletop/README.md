### Tabletop simulator Craps script

usage:

Latest save file for this fork is generally available from this workshop link before it is in this repository:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2104569835

but this script can be extended to any craps table, just need to create your
own scripting zone for pass line / fields etc

what's missing:

- come bet logic
- cetain middle of the table bets (no hops, no C&E)
- Don't Pass / Don't Come
- better documentation
